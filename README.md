Bioinformatics Research

Bioinformatics Research Group

The Bioinformatics Research Group, led by Dr. Xijin Ge, is devoted to using the tools of mathematics, computer science, and the biological sciences to explore the frontiers of the natural world. Our research focuses on using, discovering and implementing statistical, machine learning and data mining algorithms to find patterns of interest within the mass of publicly available biological data. Members of our group are involved in studying evolutionary comparative genomics, text mining, and analysis of gene expression data.
This is supported by National Sciene Foundation through SD EPSCoR program, and also by SDSU Department of Mathmatics and Statistics
